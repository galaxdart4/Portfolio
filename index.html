                    <h3>Bridges Website</h3>
                    <p>As part of a team, I helped create a Bridges Website using ReactJS. Our website stores information for various bridges in a JSON file, presents them to the user along with with select images from a stored gallery, and allows the user to filter the bridges on display.</p>

                    <h3>Vacancy Search</h3>
                    <p>I created a simple Job Vacancy search site which allows users to search for a specific job using keywords, and allows them to calculate their income for their chosen job. The site uses Javascript to search through a given Job Vacancies Database API, and to do the income calculations according to pre-selected parameters.</p>
